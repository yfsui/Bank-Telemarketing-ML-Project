# Bank Telemarketing Analysis

## Introduction

This project analyzes a Portuguese bank's direct phone call marketing campaigns, which aimed to promote term deposits among existing customers. The campaigns were carried out from May 2008 to November 2010.

***The main objective is to predict customers' responses to future marketing campaigns***, through classification and regression models, so that the bank can focus its marketing efforts on the most responsive customers. The models would help the bank to secure deposits more efficiently, save marketing costs and reduce undesirable advertisements to customers.

## Data Source
